# Spatial Reduction

To extend IPC methods to rigid body dynamics and contact mechanics, we can employ subspace methods to effectively reduce the system's degrees of freedom (DOFs). Since a rigid body serves as an idealized model for extremely stiff real-world objects with negligible deformation, it does not require a large number of DOFs. This observation motivates the Affine Body Dynamics (ABD) {{#cite lan2022affine}} method. Depending on the choice of subspace, this approach can also be adapted into various algorithms suitable for different categories of soft bodies.
